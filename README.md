# gtimer
gtimer is a programmable controller for the GARDENA [Fully Automatic Flower Box Watering](https://www.gardena.com/int/products/watering/holiday-watering/fully-automatic-flower-box-watering/900916701/) system.
Thanks to an ATMEGA microcontroller and a RTC module very flexible timings can be achieved. A temperature module can influence those timings during the course of the day based on the ambience temperature.
